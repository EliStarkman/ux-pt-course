# Impact Canvas Review

^ Have each student share which problem they chose and present their impact canvas. This should be informal and conversational.

# The importance of empathy

Empathy is perhaps the most critical factor in the UX process. Without the ability to understand a unique users context, goals, emotions, and motivations, we cannot be sure we are creating a solution they can use.

^ It is common for people to create solutions by thinking about what THEY need or want. We assume that our motivations, needs, and goals are common and shared.

^ Empathy for designers does not mean placing yourself in someone else's shoes and experiencing the world as they do. Doing so is difficult and not easily communicated to others in your organization. Empathy means taking the time to carry out proper user research and using it to guide your decisions.

^ Empathy can be challenging to maintain, and it takes practice. Conducting empathy exercises will help you to increase your empathic understanding.

# Highs and Lows

**How often:** Daily or weekly.

**How to do it:** Share one high and one low with the rest of the team. These high's and low's could be personal or professional. Share in a stand-up or a group chat. The goal here is to see people differently. Hearing about their lives and seeing a different side of them will help you to empathize with others.

# Emotion Check

**How often:** Several times a day.

**How to do it:** Set a timer for yourself, have it go off at set intervals. When the timer goes off, answer these questions in a journal: What is your mood? Why are you feeling this way? That's it. It takes just a couple of minutes and helps you to get in touch with your emotions throughout the day.

# Ideation

Ideation is merely the formation of ideas or concepts. In the context of design, ideation is the term we use for the creative process of generating ideas together.

^ This process can take the form of group or individual brainstorming. Whether you start on your own or within a group, there are some important things to keep in mind:

---

# Keep an open mind

Ideation requires a *judgment-free zone*. All participants must feel safe to share their wildest and worst ideas. The focus is not on finding the RIGHT solution; the focus is on surfacing all the POSSIBLE solutions.

---

# Don't start with ideation

Ideation should only come after you have *empathized* with your users and *defined* the problem.

---

# Have the right environment

Make sure you have a *clearly articulated problem* to inspire and guide the ideation. 

**Example:** How can we make checking accounts accessible for low-income people groups? Have personas and any other materials readily available during the session.

---

# Maintain structure

Set a *time-limit* and *designate a facilitator*. Eliminate distractions and discourage side-conversations or unrelated tangents.

---

# Ideation Techniques

![](images/abstract-art-blur-1114883.jpg)

---

* *Brainstorming:* Everyone throws out their wildest ideas and the group builds off of them. If done on your own, this is called "Braindumping." If members write them down first and bring them to the meeting, it is called "BrainWriting."

* *Worst Idea:* The opposite of throwing out your best or wildest ideas. The focus here is to produce the worst possible ideas first. This technique loosens the group and makes people more comfortable with contributing to the session.

---

* *Mindmapping:* Drawing out the connections between the problem and connecting ideas.

* *Crowdstorming:* Use social media (or other avenues) to target an audience for idea generation and validation.

# Prototyping

A prototype is an interactive simulation of an interface. It can be as rudimentary as a piece of paper or as sophisticated as a coded interface.

^ Prototypes are not the final solution. The purpose of a prototype is to simulate and test how users will interact with a solution.

---

* *Paper sketches:* Paper sketches are great for early-stage testing. They are easy to produce and allow you to check assumptions and validate requirements. They become less useful as a project progresses.

* *Wireframes:* More detailed than sketches but not as high-fidelity as coded prototypes. Wireframes focus on the interaction and flow rather than the look of the interface.

* *Coded prototypes:* These working models are close to the final look and feel. They gauge both the practical and aesthetic viability of a solution.
