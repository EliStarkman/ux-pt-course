## UX research methods 

### Card sorts

Card sorting is a method used to evaluate information architecture, typically for a website or application. 

**How it works:** Participants are given a set of topics and asked to organize them in a way that makes sense to them. Participants may also suggest alternative names/labels for these topics and categories. You can use actual cards, post-it notes, or software tools.

**Types:** 

*Open Card Sort:* Participants organize topics in a way that makes sense to them and then name each group. Use this type of card sort to understand how users group content and what names they associate with that content.

*Closed Card Sort:* Participants sort content into predefined categories. Use this technique when you are constrained by set categories and want to learn how users srt content based in those categories.

You can also use both types.

### Surveys

Done online, these structured questionnaires can vary in length and format. 

**How it works:** These surveys are distributed to targeted groups that fit the demographic from which you are seeking information. The answers are collected in a database to be interpreted.

**When should I use one?** 

Surveys can be used at any stage of development/design. Surveys can help you understand the following on a macro and a micro level:

- User needs
- User frustrations
- User motivations
