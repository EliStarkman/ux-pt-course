## UX research methods 
There are many methods available for conducting research and gathering data. The methods listed below represent a baseline toolkit for conducting research.

### User Interviews
User interviews are typically conducted at the beginning, or in the early stages of, a project.  

**How it works:** These interviews typically last for 30-60 minutes and allow you the opportunity to understand their needs, beliefs, struggles, and experiences. They can be conducted in person, by phone, or video-call.

### Contextual Interviews
These are different from user interviews. In contextual interviewing, you will observe users working in their environment (office, home, car, etc.).

**How it works:** In this interview, the interaction between yourself and the participant is minimal. You are there to watch, listen, and take notes on how the user goes about an activity. You can ask questions but only to clarify or gain better understanding about a particular choice.

### User Journey Mapping

User journey mapping captures the experience of a user as they interact with a product. The focus is on the user's feelings and thoughts as they interact with a product. The user journey is linear. 

The purpose of journey mapping is to understand the highs and lows users experience when interacting with a product. Doing so will highlight pain points and opportunities.

**How it works:** If you are starting on a new solution, begin with a user journey. Journey maps can take nearly any form. A series of post-it notes, a journal, or a spreadsheet. Choose the medium and structure that works best for you and your team.


### User Flows

User flows differ from user journeys. User flows are a visualization of the path a user follows across a product or feature. The focus here is on the task the user is attempting to accomplish and the many paths available. The user flow is not linear as it contains many decisions and possible routes.

The purpose of a user flow is to understand the paths users take through a product. In the early design stages, it helps designers understand the solution and to explain the solution to others. When examining an existing flow, it can highlight opportunities to improve the overall flow.

**How it works:** If you are working on improving an existing solution, start with a user flow. User flows can also take many forms. You may begin by creating one on a whiteboard or using sticky notes while in a meeting. The final flow should take digital form. Sketch is an excellent tool for creating these flows.


### Personas

Personas are realistic representations of your users. They should be based on both quantitaive and qualitative data. 

**How it works:** Identify the major user segments for your product or service. Conduct user research using surveys, interviews

### Card sorts

Card sorting is a method used to evaluate information architecture, typically for a website or application. 

**How it works:** Participants are given a set of topics and asked to organize them in a way that makes sense to them. Participants may also suggest alternative names/labels for these topics and categories. You can use actual cards, post-it notes, or software tools.

**Types:** 

*Open Card Sort:* Participants organize topics in a way that makes sense to them and then name each group. Use this type of card sort to understand how users group content and what names they associate with that content.

*Closed Card Sort:* Participants sort content into predefined categories. Use this technique when you are constrained by set categories and want to learn how users srt content based in those categories.

You can also use both types.

### Surveys

Done online, these structured questionnaires can vary in length and format. 

**How it works:** These surveys are distributed to targeted groups that fit the demographic from which you are seeking information. The answers are collected in a database to be interpreted.

**When should I use one?** 

Surveys can be used at any stage of development/design. Surveys can help you understand the following on a macro and a micro level:

- User needs
- User frustrations
- User motivations

### Usability testing

Test a product or design with users to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed solution. Participants attempt to complete a task or series of tasks while obervers watch and listen. Usability testing will help highlight usability problems and allow you to collect quantitative/qualitative data on user interactions. 

**How it works:** To run an effective test, you must have a solid plan in place for testing, recruiting participants, and analyzing the findings. You can conduct usability testing at nearly any stage of design. You can conduct testing on one particular feature or across an entire application.

**Lab Activity / Take Home:** Activity: Using the techniques reviewed in the first class and today, develop personas and/or user journeys for the users of your product. Ideate on the design problem chosen in the first week.
