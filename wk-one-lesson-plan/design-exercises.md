# Spotify Artist Catalogue Manager

Spotify has decided to give artists control of their catalogues on their platform. For the first time, artists can manage their own albums, upload their own artwork, sell specific merchandise, add lyrics to their music etc. and it’s all on their own terms.
Design a Mac-based editor and artist management system that allows artists to manage their presence on Spotify. The solution should account for all existing artist content on Spotify but feel free to get creative and add additional features that an artist might find useful.

**Constraint:** You are designing a Mac desktop app, you will be relegated to the OS’s abilities but you can disregard any web-related technical constraints because they don’t apply here.


# Google Enterprise Sales Funnel

You are consulting Google on an important strategic decision for their enterprise offerings; they want to know whether it’s worth introducing a sales funnel management tool onto their Enterprise Gmail interface. Google believes that because a majority of their enterprise users discuss business on their email platform and because they are the lexicon of most people’s business contacts, that they are in a position to both make the sales process more efficient and make the likelihood of closing business higher.
26% of Google’s Enterprise users engage in sales weekly, 40% engage in some sort of funnel management (whether sales, hiring, or some other decision funnel).
A typical sales funnel includes Leads, Inquiries, Prospects, Quotes and finally a new customer.
Recommend a funnel management flow to Google. Make sure the flow accounts for a user making initial contact with a lead from within gmail and then managing that lead through the entire funnel. What else can gmail do to put the odds of closing business in favor of their user?

**Constraint:** No constraints

# Roomates

A few trends of note: 54% of the world’s population live in urban communities, the average marriage age for men is 29 (up from 26 two decades ago) and for women is 27 (up from 23 in the same time period). Given these trends, city dwellers tend to spend most of their twenties living with roommates. Finding and keeping a good roommate, however, gets harder as more people swarm into cities.
Design a mobile product experience that appeals to millennials that makes it safe to find the ideal roommate in New York City. Design the experience from the perspective of person who is looking for a roommate as well as the one who is looking for the apartment. Once the ideal roommate is found, what else can this product do to make the roommate experience better?
We are looking for you to identify pain points in the “finding/keeping a good roommate” journey and to find ways to solve for those pain points.

**Constraint:** Stick to existing mobile capabilities of iOS and Android.


# Personalising audiobooks
Audiobooks and podcasting are the fastest growing audio segments on mobile. Users who listen to audiobooks don’t enjoy the benefits of dog-earing pages, highlighting excerpts or leaving notes on their favorite pages… they also lose the nostalgic aspects of owning a book and watching it age. This leaves a lot to be desired from the audio experience on mobile.
Design an Audiobook or Podcasting mobile app that is highly personal, highly interactive and with the ability to bring even more utility to the user than a book ever could.

**Constraint:** All suggested technologies need to exist, or have the ability to realistically exist within the next 6 months.
