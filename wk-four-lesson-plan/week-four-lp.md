# Week Four

## Review

**Activity:** Review wireframes and user flows, answer questions and give feedback. 

Look back at the work you have done so far and answer the following questions:

1. Do you have a well-defined problem? Do you feel you are solving the right problem?

1. Do you understand the user, their motives and needs? Is there an angle or a user you are missing?

When going through your wireframes, ask yourself the following questions:

 * Will this item appear on every page or just this page? 

 * How will this look on mobile devices?

 * How do I go back to the previous page? 

 * How will this look on a larger display (1200px and up)?

 * Will the user see a message to confirm their action?

## Grid / Spacing

Grid systems allow you to arrange content in a predictable, scalable way. Grids have a long, rich history in print design. In digital design, they provide guides for designers to create layouts that support different screen sizes.

Grids consist of equal sized columns separated by margins. Content can be placed in one or more of the columns.

**Activity:** Open up Sketch and walk the class through the creation of artboards with different **grid layouts**.

## Typography

Typography can be an elusive and intimidating skill for the beginning designer. We look at type every day without understanding or fully realizing what goes into it. As with anything, it takes knowledge and practice.

**Why is good typography important?**
* The typeface you choose affects the way the readers emotionally connect with the content. 

(add an example of comic sans versus another font)

* The spacing between letters and lines of text can make your content easier or harder to read.

 (add examples of good and bad spacing and alignment).

## Elements of typography

### Kerning

Kerning is the process of adjusting the spacing between characters in a proportional font, in order to make the text easier to read.

### Tracking (Letter Spacing)

Tracking is different from kerning. Tracking adjusts the letter spacing uniformly over a range of characters. Adjusting tracking can also improve readability.

### Leading (Line height)

Leading is the old typographers term for the space between lines of text (vertically).

### Typeface
There are three types of typeface: serif, sans-serif, and decorative.
Choosing typefaces can be overwhelming. Keep these rules in mind when choosing:

* Decorative fonts are often creative and don't make for easy reading. They are best used for headlines or as accent text.

(add examples of decorative fonts)

* Serif fonts are considered more conservative and traditional. They give an air of seriousness and are thought to be slightly more difficult to read in digital form. In digital media, serif fonts are often used for headlines versus body text, but there are no hard rules.

(add examples of serif fonts)

* Sans-serif fonts are considered to be more modern than serif fonts. 

(add examples of sans-serif fonts)

* Pairing complimentary fonts can make your content more comfortable to read. If you aren't sure how to pair fonts, tools like Font Pair will give you recommendations.

(add examples of font-pairings)

### Hierarchy

Hierarchy is the arrangement of items in a way that some objects are perceived as being "above," "below," or "at the same level as" as other items. Hierarchy in typography is used to guide the reader through the content. Position and text size indicates what a reader should look at first, second, third, etc. It also makes your text more scannable.

(add equal, hierarchical, and hierarchical with spacing examples)

### Contrast
Contrasting type size, color, weight, and style can add impact and interest to your design. It can also support ideas and reinforce emotions.

(add contrast examples)

### Consistency
Keep your use of text style, size, and color consistent. Do not use an excessive number of fonts and colors.

### Alignment
Keep your text aligned properly within the grid and with other items in your layout. Don't overuse center-alignment. Center-aligned text is appropriate for headlines and short spans of text. Centered paragraphs are harder to read and should be avoided.

### Whitespace
The spaces NOT taken up by text are as important as those with text. Whitespace in the form of margins, padding, line-height, and letter spacing.

( review examples with spacing)

### Color
The colors you choose for your text are important in setting the right tone and for accessibility. We will talk more about color theory in the next segment.
