# Week Four

## Review

**Activity:** Review wireframes and user flows, answer questions and give feedback. 

Look back at the work you have done so far and answer the following questions:

1. Do you have a well-defined problem? Do you feel you are solving the right problem?

1. Do you understand the user, their motives and needs? Is there an angle or a user you are missing?

When going through your wireframes, ask yourself the following questions:

 * Will this item appear on every page or just this page? 

 * How will this look on mobile devices?

 * How do I go back to the previous page? 

 * How will this look on a larger display (1200px and up)?

 * Will the user see a message to confirm their action?

## Grid / Spacing

Grid systems allow you to arrange content in a predictable, scalable way. Grids have a long, rich history in print design. In digital design, they provide guides for designers to create layouts that support different screen sizes.

Grids consist of equal sized columns separated by margins. Content can be placed in one or more of the columns.

**Activity:** Open up Sketch and create artboards with different grid layouts.
