# Week Four

**Activity:** Review wireframes and user flows, answer questions and give feedback. 

Look back at the work you have done so far and answer the following questions:

1. Do you have a well-defined problem? Do you feel you are solving the right problem?

1. Do you understand the user, their motives and needs? Is there an angle or a user you are missing?

1. When going through your wireframes, ask yourself the following questions:

 * Will this item appear on every page or just this page? 

 * How will this look on mobile devices?

 * How do I go back to the previous page? 

 * How will this ook on a larger display (1200px and up)?

 * Will the user see a message to confirm their action?
