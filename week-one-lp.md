# Week One

## How do UX/UI differ and in what ways are they similar?

UX is short for *User Experience*. UX refers to the overall experience you or I have when interacting with a product. This includes the emotions and attitudes that a product evokes from us while we are using it. (*add image)

UI is short for *User Interface*. UI refers to the interaction between humans and computers, particularly the space in which it occurs. This includes the graphical user interface (GUI) which contains controls users can select and interact with. (*add image)

So, **UX** is all about the way a user experiences an application, and **UI** is all about the way a user interacts with an application. It sounds like *almost* the same thing. Well, almost. There is overlap between the two, but there are some significant differences.

### Both UX and UI Design Practice include some or all of the following
*(depending on the company you work for, your role, etc.)*

* Collaboration 

* Problem-solving

* Analytical and critical thinking

* Conducting UX research

* Interpreting  UX research

* Wireframing

* Prototyping

* User flows and user journeys

* Visual design

* Interaction design

You can't have UX without UI, and vice versa. So, how do we define the boundaries between the two? UX often focuses on the big picture, the macro.  The focus is on understanding the problem and finding the best solution. This means talking to users, researching if necessary, creating wireframes and flows, all to create the best experience for the user. UI focuses on the details, the micro. The focus here is on taking the wireframes, flows, and learnings from the research and creating the aspects of the user interface. 

# Design Thinking
Sounds magical, doesn't it? I hate to break it to you but...it isn't. Design Thinking is a fancy name for the process designers (or anyone) can use when solving a problem. Design thinking can be considered an ideology and process. 

## Ideology
As an ideology, it centers on understanding people first. The focus is on gathering information to understand the people and the problems they are facing before attempting to solve those problems for them.

## Process
There are no defined or set steps to design thinking, though you can find dozen of articles and books that say there are. At its base, design thinking is an iterative process of ongoing experimentation with the sole purpose of finding the right solution.

## Four principles
Christoph Meinel and Harry Leifer of the Hasso-Plattner-Institute of Design at Stanford University, California defined **four design thinking principles** (reference-https://www.bookdepository.com/Design-Thinking-Research-Christoph-Meinel/9783319609669)

1. **The human rule** - All design activity is social in nature and will help us maintain a human-centric point of view.

1. **The ambiguity rule** - Ambiguity is inevitable, experiment at the limits of your knowledge. Becoming comfortable with the unknown will allow you to experiment more to see things differently.

1. **All design is redesign** - Technology and social circumstances change, but human needs do not. We are redesigning products, services, or features to fulfill these needs.

1. **The tangibility rule** - Prototypes make ideas tangible. Designers can communicate more effectively using prototypes.

### Phases in the Design Thinking Process
(*add image)

**Empathize**

Know and understand the user. Observe, engage, understand.

**Define**

Define the problem using findings from the empathy phase. 

**Ideate**

Start forming solutions using ideation techniques (brainstorming, mind-mapping, etc.) Narrow the field down to a few ideas with which to move forward.

**Prototype**

Turn these ideas into something tangible. This phase is all about experimenting and letting go as you learn what works, and what doesn't work.

**Test**

This phase goes hand in hand with prototyping. User testing with prototypes will give answers that may lead you right back to creating new prototypes.
