# Week One

## How do UX/UI differ and in what ways are they similar?

UX is short for *User Experience*. UX refers to the overall experience you or I have when interacting with a product. This includes the emotions and attitudes that a product evokes from us while we are using it. (*add image)

UI is short for *User Interface*. UI refers to the interaction between humans and computers, particularly the space in which it occurs. This includes the graphical user interface (GUI) which contains controls users can select and interact with. (*add image)

So, **UX** is all about the way a user experiences an application, and **UI** is all about the way a user interacts with an application. It sounds like *almost* the same thing. Well, almost. There is overlap between the two, but there are some significant differences.

### Both UX and UI Design Practice include some or all of the following
*(depending on the company you work for, your role, etc.)*

* Collaboration 

* Problem-solving

* Analytical and critical thinking

* Conducting UX research

* Interpreting  UX research

* Wireframing

* Prototyping

* User flows and user journeys

* Visual design

* Interaction design

You can't have UX without UI, and vice versa. So, how do we define the boundaries between the two? UX often focuses on the big picture, the macro.  The focus is on understanding the problem and finding the best solution. This means talking to users, researching if necessary, creating wireframes and flows, all to create the best experience for the user. UI focuses on the details, the micro. The focus here is on taking the wireframes, flows, and learnings from the research and creating the aspects of the user interface.
