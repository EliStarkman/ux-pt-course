## How do UX/UI differ and in what ways are they similar?

UX is short for *User Experience*. UX refers to the overall experience you or I have when interacting with a product. This includes the emotions and attitudes that product evokes from us while we are using it. (*add image)

UI is short for *User Interface*. UI refers to the interaction between humans and computers, particularly the space in which it occurs. This includes the graphical user interface (GUI) which contains controls users can select and interact with. (*add image)

So, **UX** is all about the way a user experiences an applictaion, and **UI** is all about the way a user interacts with an application. Sounds like *almost* the same thing, right? Well, almost. There is overlap between the two, but there are some big differences.
